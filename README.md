My Reputation Management Plugin
========================

A reputation management wp-plugin

I am looking for a reputation management plugin that is based on my html demo here. 
http://demuk.co.uk/reputation/[http://demuk.co.uk/reputation/]

The system is simple and it works like this,  people get given the url or a card with a QR code on it. They visit the url and are presented with the page along the lines of the above. 

If they are unhappy with the service, they will be taken to a form to complete, the form is then sent to the email of the business, if they are happy with the service then we will direct them to whichever review site we are working on at that time.

In short we need to generate for each business, 
A page as per link
A form to send to them, and a copy for us.

Information we will need to insert to build the page (Admin access control panel)
Name of business
Business logo
Facebook like option url
Email address (for form)
url for ‘happy’ direction (as in we send the happy’ people to this url) we will change the url once we have achieved so this needs to be a field we can edit on the fly.

The process will be that we get a customer, we have a domain name that is like business-reviews.com (made up domain) we will create a page for our customers along the lines of domain.com/customer-name/ This is where the information will then appear for that client.

We then go into the admin, fill in the fields required above, and the pages are published. As we will need to change the target site, we must have access to each clients panel on the fly. And some way of dealing with hundreds of clients.

The pages will not appear as published anywhere, they are only seen by typing in the url, they will all be spider blocked.

We will have multiple clients on this site possibly hundreds on there, and they will all have their own 2 pages of information 
1 review page
2. form

They will share a common thank you page.

The public will be posting the information(review) no need for registration at all.
